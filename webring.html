				<h3>Tangerine Scholarship</h3>
			
				<p>The Tangerine Scholarship Foundation is honored to announce its inaugural round of funding for those interested in learning to become auditory artists. Auditory artistry can range from music composition to vocal editing, and anything else that artists have the audacity to explore.</p>

				<p>The Foundation was originally created by benefactors Viola and Burt ‘Beeps’ Marc. Viola Marc, born Viola Fuffo, was the heiress to the Fuffo Confection Company fortune, the company that popularised jelly bean candy throughout the United Kingdom. (Please see <i>Growth and Development of the Gelata Faba</i> by Carlton Butterbaum<b>*</b> for additional jelly bean history and lore). Not to be outdone, Burt ‘Beeps’ Marc brought his own money to the family as a world-renowned athlete in the marble circuit.</p>

				<p>Mr. and Mrs. Marc frequently talked of dreams where they would be able to inspire the next generation of auditory artists. The Marcs solidified their plans one fateful evening, huddled next to their old, rusty fridge whilst eating tangerines. Hence, the name and mission of the Tangerine Scholarship Foundation was born into the world.</p>

				<p>The Tangerine Scholarship is open to Yorkshire applicants only. For application purposes, Yorkshire is merely a state of mind and applicants are welcome from all three time zones. If you are wondering if you are in the Yorkshire state of mind, simply ask yourself, ‘Ey up?’</p>

				<p>Whilst the Foundation welcomes applications from lads and blokes (of all genders), special consideration is given to those who can demonstrate of a history of any or all of the following actions and beliefs:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><i>Redistribution of wealth</i> — applicants who have directly participated in the theft and redistribution of items including but not limited to houses, vehicles, and internal organs will receive priority consideration</li>
					<li><i>Staunch support of language purity measure</i> — no foul language, including but not limited to “h words,” is permitted in application materials and applicants who espouse a disdain for such low-brow language will receive favorable consideration</li>
					<li><i>Ability to convey attitude with a single pictogram</i> — auditory artists in particular should not be limited to the confines of traditional English language and as such, applicants who can, for instance, display a sense of smugness and zero remorse through the use of, hypothetically, a single small image of a laughing dog, will receive extra consideration</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Scholarship winners will be funded for an entire year of hands-on learning experiences. Course topics will include removing breaths and mouth sounds, creating hype crimes, and distributing a seemingly neverending supply of images in which their face has been placed over that of a more famous person.</p>

				<i><p>If you would like to apply to the Tangerine Scholarship Foundation, please send your name, favorite jelly bean flavor (mint apologists need not apply), and a VHS with your best Sean Bean impression to:</p>
				
				<p align="center">Tangerine Scholarship Fund
				<br/>PO Box 42069
				<br/>Wigan
				<br/>WN1 1BS</span></p></i>

				<p><b>*The sole copy of <i>Growth and Development of the Gelata Faba</i> by Carlton Butterbaum is securely located at The Magnus Institute, London. Please do not contact them for details on reading the book. All inquiries will be denied.</b></p>
