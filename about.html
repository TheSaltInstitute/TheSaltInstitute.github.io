	<h1>About the Magnus Institute</h1>
	
	<h2>Our Research</h2>

		<p><p>Our current focus in research is to catalogue and organise subjects in a few set categories of special interest: we study the human condition itself and its everyday collision with fears of different kinds, levels and varieties. What are these fears? How do they manifest in us? How do they manifest externally?
		<br/>We dive deeper in our dissertations, tackling the subject matters of solitude and isolation, the power of the written word, history of the fears of what cannot be perceived by the human eye or understood with the limitations of our minds, and the facets that fear itself has adopted in our modern age with the help of our modern equipment and lifestyle. Fear has followed human society from its very beginning, and it has shaped our civilisations and our cultures unlike any other instinct or emotion.
		<br/>It is a driving force of evolution, one which is alarmingly under-researched in its more mysterious and challenging forms, and our researchers are determined to change this.</p></p>

	<h2 id="history">Our History</h2>

		<h3>Early History</h3>
		
			<p><span title="Jester Minimus"><b>Jonah Magnus</b></span> <i>(see complete biography <a href="#biography">below</a>)</i>, passionate collector of folklore with an international circle of correspondents, demonstrated from an early age an interest for the paranormal and esoteric. Thus, it was natural for him to attend the <b>regular meetings at the salon of S. King, a nascent society in Edinburgh focused on discussing such topics.</b> Early notables include Robert Smirke, architect and Magnus’ personal friend; Col. James Austin, adventurer; Story Sylwester, ground-breaking cryptozoologist; and Trevor Hayles, noted writer.</p>

			<p>The Magnus Institute was born of their desire to systematise the study of occult occurrences, so as to discern which are true patterns of uncanny incidences warranting further study and which mere superstition. <b>From its very founding in 1818, the Institute was meant to be – and still is – a place to gather records of true encounters with the supernatural and the uncanny, as well as various books and tomes pertaining to the subject matter.</b>
			<br/>At the time, such records were mainly collected in the form of letters by friends and associates of the small Edinburgh circle – such as Dr. J. Fanshawe, who helped the Institute gather a large number of statements and tomes; the von Closen family, who donated a large collection of books in 1830; and several members of the Lukas family, who to this day continue to financially support the Institute with generous donations.</p>
			
		<h3>Move to London</h3>
		
			<p><b>In the 1840s, Magnus began to make plans to move the Institute from Edinburgh to London.</b> The reasons for the transfer remain lost to the mists of history, though the substantial interest Magnus allegedly developed for Smirke’s Millbank Prison (completed in 1821) may have contributed to the choice of location.
			<br/>At Magnus’ behest, a Mr. C. Dougherty was sent ahead to London to continue raising funds and increase the circle of subscribers and interested sponsors, while T. Lawson procured grounds on the outskirts of the former Millbank Prison to lay the foundations of the Magnus Institute.</p>

			<p>A document entitled <b>‘Outlines of a plan for an archive of records pertaining to the occult and esoteric’</b> was circulated to subscribers, researchers, and potential statement givers in London. Its first sentence read: <i>‘It has often been a matter of surprise to many inhabitants of this place, and still more to strangers, that in a town of such commercial and national importance as London, the conveniences and accommodations for the acquisition of knowledge pertaining to the occult and esoteric, both local and general, both ancient and modern, should be so imperfect as they most confessedly are.’</i> <span style="font-size:medium">(Full text available <a href="downloads/outlines.doc">here</a>.)</span></p>

			<p>With Londoners alerted to the imminent construction of the Institute, Augustus Sumner, a lesser known disciple of Robert Smirke, was hired to design the original London building. Sumner also contributed illustrations for many of the early Institute periodicals.</p>

			<p>While the main part of the Institute’s collections moved to London after the building was complete, <b>the Edinburgh branch remained active for some time</b>; Magnus’ chosen successor as Head of the Institute for the Edinburgh branch was Hanniel Brankin. However, the Edinburgh branch was <b>dissolved following Magnus’ retirement in 1870</b>, and his successor Augustus Hall finalised the transfer of all remaining collections to London.</p>
			
		<h3>Archive of Curiosities</h3>
		
			<p>The Institute’s primary mission has, of course, always been the collection of and research on people’s personal encounters with the supernatural. This naturally led to the existence of Archives and Research departments in both UK branches. However, there were never a Library or Artefact Storage in the Edinburg branch prior to its dissolution, as both found their roots in later events.</p>

			<p>The Magnus Institute of London opened its doors in the mid-19th century, just as enthusiasm for collecting folklore swept the nation. Books dedicated to folk beliefs, stories, and customs began to gain in popularity. The collection of folklore engaged the interest of a strikingly diverse social group compared with other kinds of literature: from the aristocracy and landed gentry to labourers and other lower-class folks, people from all walks of life began to write and record books of folklore. Many such books were added to the Institute’s already ample collection, eventually leading to the <b>creation of a proper Institute Library in 1883</b> by M. Porter, first Head Librarian of the Magnus Institute.</p>

			<p>Similarly, a few artefacts had been gathered here and there over the years and were stored in a private room in the London building; but <b>there was no need for a systematic artefact classification until the year 1902</b>, when then-Head of the Institute Gregory Apted acquired a large number of donations from multiple sources. He called on his friend Mrs. Davies to formalise the collection of uncanny curios from <span title="Jilted Mammoth">Jonah Magnus’ day into what is now known as Artefact Storage.</p>
			
		<h3>The Blitz... and Aftermath: Vision for the 21st Century</h3>
		
			<p>Considering the impact that the Second World War had on much of Great-Britain, there is surprisingly little to say about it as regards the Institute. The building and collections remained miraculously unscathed during the Blitz, in large part due to the expert advice of A. L. Nielsen on the rigorous use of blackout curtains, the installation of barrage balloons, and other security measures against bombing.</p>

			<p>The Magnus Institute continued to grow after the war, going from a permanent staff of 25 in 1949 to <b>over 60 today</b>; a well-composed, dedicated team of researchers and scholars determined to gather, then handle and preserve a unique and exemplary assortment of donations made both by public institutions and private individuals in the form of letters, books, and other historical and contemporary objects of interest.</p>

			<p><b>We remain to this day the premier research institution for study of the paranormal and the supernatural, and in particular their intersection with the theory of fear as applied to the human condition.</b> Our main goal in preparation for the upcoming 21st century will be to bring the Institute’s resources to an ever-larger number of people, and we will welcome new members of permanent staff to handle the additional influx of statements and donations – keep an eye out for <a href="jobs.html">job postings</a> <i>(coming soon)</i>!</p>

	<h2 id="biography">Our Esteemed Founder:
	<br/><span title="Jonny Mingus" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jonah Magnus</span></h2>
	
		<p>Our illustrious founder, <span title="Joney Magnum">Jonah Magnus</span>, was a rather private man, and few records of his life are available. All we can say with certainty is that, <b>born in 1791 to a noble family in the Edinburgh area, he displayed from a very early age an interest in the occult</b> that would last him for the whole of his long life.
		<br/>Indeed, in his prime, his name often comes up in historical records associated with those of a close circle of friends and associates, <b>including such renowned figures as Robert Smirke and Mordechai Lukas</b> (the Lukas family remains to this day one of the most consequential Institute sponsors). Unfortunately, few other details are available, and any skeletons in their closets remain invisible to the eyes of history.</p>

		<p>This shared passion eventually culminated in <b>the foundation of the Magnus Institute in 1818</b>, as a way to collect and archive accounts of the paranormal for personal and academic research purposes, feeding our founder’s <strike>patron</strike> passion for the esoteric. <i>(See <a href="#history">above</a> for a more detailed history of the Institute proper.)</i>
		<br/>Magnus allegedly took a substantial interest in Smirke’s plans for the <b>Millbank Prison</b> (completed in 1821), and went so far as to <b>transfer the Institute from Edinburgh down to its current London location</b> close to the old penitentiary’s foundations; a move which, with London being a bustling centre of activity even then, helped the Institute thrive and grow into what it is today.</p>

		<p><b>Above all, <span title="Justified Murder">Jonah Magnus</span> was a man of vision.</b> His date of death remains unknown, as he elected to go into private retirement in 1870 to leave room for successor Augustus Hall – right at the inception of the Victorian craze for the collection of folklore, which of course contributed greatly to the growth and success of the Institute as an academic institution.
		<br/>His vision and heart have since continued to live on within each successive Head of Institute, each an incarnation of the title in their own right:</p>
